# STEPS TO INSTALL SASS

## 1. Create a new directory called (for me 0x03-sass_scss).
## 2.
        For Linux installation (Optional)
    In your ubuntu terminal install node version 20.16 as follows:
    $ curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.39.7/install.sh | bash
    Exit the terminal using the exit command then reopen it when done.

        Installation Anywhere (Optional)
    If you have node installed, then install SASS using the following command:
    npm install sass -v 3.7.4
    But if you don't have node, installed it first;
        Visit the official Node.js site: https://nodejs.org/ 
        Click LTS (Long Term Support) version.
        Download and run the installer.
        It will install both Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager).
        Then confirm installation. In your terminal, do
        node -v
        npm -v
        AFter installing node, follow the previous instruction to install SASS
